> Simplicity is not the absence of complexity, it’s mastery over it.
> I believe that every system, like every person, should evolve; through iteration, feedback, and purpose.

<br/>
-  I approach problems like puzzles: break them down, find patterns, build back stronger.
-  I love ambient and instrumental music while coding; it helps me enter a flow state.
-  Vision: To engineer data systems that think before they break.
-  Motto: *“If code is language, then debugging is philosophy.”*
